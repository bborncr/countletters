# countletters

Write a function countLetters that can return to us all the unique characters that exist in a string that is passed into the function.

Furthermore, the function should also report back how many instances of each letter were found in the string.

return letterCount;

However, our function countLetters needs to return an object that can represent the stats for the sentence it is given: all the characters found in the input string, and their respective counts.

What should the object returned back by countLetters look like?

Perhaps it could return an object where each unique character encountered is a property of the object and the value for that property/key should be the number of occurrences for that character.
